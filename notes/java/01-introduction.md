# Introduction to Java

## Java History :
Java is a general-purpose , object-oriented programming language and platform developed by **Sun Microsystems in 1991 at california, USA.**
- Originally called by **Oak** by James Gosling. Whois  know as father of Java.
- 1995 : Oak renamed " Java " and JDK Beta version released.
- 1996 : The first Official stable version , Java 1.0 was released. 
- Now Java owned by Oracle Corporation. It's latest version, Java SE JDK 23.

## Platform :
Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs is known as a platform. Since java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API , it is called a platform.

## Features of Java
- **Simple and easy :** 
Java is easy to learn and its syntax is simple , clear and based on c/c++.
- **Object-Oriented :**
Java is based on OOPs Concept. Everything in java is treated as object, enabling code reusability and modularity.
- **Platform-Independent ans Portable:** 
Java program compiles into bytecode, which can run on any device (OS) with a JVM  &  without any modification.
- **Robust and secure :** 
Java has strong memory management and exception handling features.Java has built-in security features that help protect applications from threats
- **Dynamic and Extensible :** 
Java supports dynamic loading of classes. Its mean classesare loaded on demand. Java support  functions written in other language such as c/c++. These function called Native Methods. These are linked dynamically at runtime.
- **Multithreaded :** 
Java supports multithreading, allowing deal with many tasks at once.
- **Distributed :** 
Java supports distributed computing with its extensive network libraries.
- **High Performance :** 
Java is designed for high performance with its just-in-time compiler.

## Java Editions
- **Java Standard Edition (SE) :** 
This is the standard version of Java used for developing desktop applications.
- **Java Enterprise Edition (EE) :**
This is used for developing large-scale, distributed, and multi-tiered applications.
- **Java Micro Edition (ME) :**
This is used for developing applications for mobile devices and embedded systems.

## Java Enviroment
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) :**
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications.

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE) :**
The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components required to run Java applications.

- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM) :**
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. It converts Java bytecode into machine code and executes it on the host machine
